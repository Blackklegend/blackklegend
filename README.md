My actual name is Vitor, and I'm Brazilian; a beautiful country, lot's of food, places to travel to, all that good stuff. I know four idioms: Portuguese which's my first language, English, Spanish, and LIBRAS, which is the Brazilian sign language. All of them I've learned alone took me a while though, and I'm not the best, works out fine after all.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - No big projects at moment but some ideas are turning out fine, hope some of them give me fruits.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - React native

- I'm skilled with hardware and operational systems, I usually spend some time troubleshooting. Yeah, what a nerd.

- I'm not all about talking though, lol. My GitHub exists for:
  - SQL
  - C based languages

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I know the answer, I'll tell you right away, if not, we'll find it.
- ðŸ“« You can find me anywhere lol, but my discord is BlackkLegend#7487, and if you feel old school you can email me at bl4ckklegend@gmail.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: Our bodies actually can't feel temperature, just the electric charge moving around.
If it leaves your body, then you feel cold, if it enters you feel the warmth.
