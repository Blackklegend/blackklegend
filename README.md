My actual name is Vitor, and I'm Brazilian. Brazil is a beautiful country, lot's of food, places to travel to, all that good stuff. I know four idioms: Portuguese which's my first language, English, Spanish, and LIBRAS, which is the Brazilian sign language. All of them I've learned alone, which took me a while though, and I'm not the best, but it works out fine after all.

    - A website that aims to smooth the search for developers, making a bridge between client and dev.
  - [OneFlower](https://github.com/Blackklegend/Oneflower) 
    - A Minecraft modpack.

  - Maybe Flutter

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I know the answer, I'll tell you right away, if not, we'll find it.
- ðŸ“« You can find me anywhere, but my discord is BlackkLegend#3638, and if you feel old school you can email me at bl4ckklegend@gmail.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: Our bodies actually can't feel temperature, just the electric charge moving around.
If it leaves your body then you feel cold, if it enters you feel warm.
