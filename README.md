My actual name is Vitor, and I'm Brazilian. Brazil is a beautiful country, lot's good of food, places to travel to, all that good stuff. I know four idioms: Portuguese which's my first language, English, Spanish, and LIBRAS, which is the Brazilian sign language. All of them I've learnt by myself, but it took me a while, and I'm not the best, but it works out fine after all.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I know the answer, I'll tell you right away, if not, we'll find it.  

- âš¡ Fun fact: Our bodies actually can't feel temperature, just the electric charge moving around.
If it leaves your body then you feel cold, if it enters you feel warm.
