My actual name is Vitor, and I'm brazilian; beatiful country, lot's of food, places to travel to,
all that good stuff. I know four idioms: Portuguese that's my first language, English, Spanish and 
LIBRAS, which is the brazilian sign language. All of them I've learned alone, took me a while though, 
and I'm not the best, works out fine afterall.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - No big projects at moment but some ideas are turning out fine, hope some of them give me fruits.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Java
  - SQL
  - Bootstrap
  - I know that's not the best approach to learn lot's at the same time, but diversifying is also good
  so yeeee ig, anyways

- I'm skilled with hardware and operational systems, I usually spend some time troubleshooting. Yeah, what a nerd.

- Anyway, I'm not all about talking tho lol, my github exists for a reason, and they're:
  - C based languages

If it leaves your body, then you feel cold, if it enters you feel warmth.
